RomCom - Create your own romantic comedy cover (or see/save some random covers!)
---

## Overview

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well … maybe that’s true. We’ve built an app that generates romance novel covers!

## Technologies

This application uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Deployed App



## Set Up

Feel free to fork our repository and use it locally.

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. `cd` into the repository
4. Edit the site by opening main.js in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal

## Features

* You will see a random romance novel cover when the app loads.
* When you click "Show New Random Cover", you'll ... wait for it ... see a new random cover!!
* When you click Save Cover, the current cover will be added to your list of saved covers.
* You can then see your list of favorites by clicking 'View Saved Covers.''
* You can delete covers from the saved list by double clicking the cover on the 'View Saved Covers' page.
* On the 'Make Your Own Cover' page, you can then create your very own cover by following these steps.
  1. Select a source image using one of the file paths in data.js or provide a URL to an image.
  2. Add a title.
  3. Create a subtitle by adding two descriptors.
* We can't wait to see what you create!

## Future Editions

In the future we would like to do more error handling and better protection against duplicates. We could also envision using a modal to display the custom cover that a user creates, as well as the ability to drag and drop covers on the Saved Covers view.
