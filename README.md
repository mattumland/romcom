RomCom - Create your own romantic comedy cover (or see/save some random covers!)
---

## Overview

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well … maybe that’s true. We’ve built an app that generates romance novel covers!

## Technologies

This application uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Deployed App



## Set Up

Feel free to fork our repository and use it locally. 

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. `cd` into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal

## Features

* You can see a random romance novel cover when the app loads.
* When you click "Show New Random Cover", you'll ... wait for it ... see a new random cover!! 
* When you click Save Cover, the cover that you see will be added to your list of saved covers.
* You can then see your list of favorites by clicking on View Saved Covers. This is also where you can
  delete covers from your list by double clicking the cover.
* When you click on Make Your Own Cover, you can then create your very own cover.
* We can't wait to see what you create!

## Future Editions

In the future we would like to do more error handling and better protection against duplicates. We could also envision 
using a modal to display the custom cover that a user creates, as well as the ability to drag and drop covers on the 
Saved Covers view.
